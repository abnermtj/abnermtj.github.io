							<h2>Situation</h2>
							Long queue times in supermarkets are such an inconvenience. To do something about this, my team created a mobile self-checkout application. I was  
							a UX designer in the team and created proof of concepts. With a heavy focus on user testing, we iterated to the final high fidelity prototype to the right/above.

						<h2>What I did</h2>

							<p>I was particularly in charge of the scanning and paying functionality which lets users scan an item's barcode and pay for it from anywhere in the supermarket. This eliminates the need to queue entirely. To the left are some final screens I played a major role in after numerous iterations. Additionally, I contributed to standardizing the visual language. Do read on to find out our process!

							<p>So before coming up with solutions, my team sought to deeply understand the problems our target users faced when it comes to long queue times. I performed contextual inquiry with potential users and consolidated relevant pain points as features that we should include in the final product. I also tried using tools such as affinity diagrams and personas but I didn't find them helpful in my small team of five.

							<p>After spending a good two weeks understanding the problem. Our team eventually started our prototyping sprints, we used numerous methods as shown in the diagram on the left. At that point, we just blasted designs to see what stuck and iterated on what worked to slowly approach our final solution.

							<p> We conducted user tests for feedback which is where the bulk of our findings came from. We had users complete a set of tasks and observed their behaviour as carried them out. We managed to take note of even their slight struggles and used it as a gauge to tell if features were quick and intuitive. Through a feedback loop, our product got better and better. Some of our findings and the actions taken as a result are shown below.
