							<h2>Situation</h2>
							The average engineer is not very proficient in dancing. To solve this catastrophe,
							 our team wanted to prototype a small but powerful IoT device that can coach people like us to competency.
							 At the same time, we wanted it to be comfortable and usable for a variety of dance moves and dancers.

						<h2>What I did</h2>
						<p> My role was primarily to establish a fast and stable Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 communications protocol for both
							 the hardware and software side of this project. This meant I had to consider the realtime demands of our solution,
							  since we wanted immediate feedback on how well we performed a move. As our hardware moves quite vigorously during a dance, 
							  disconnections were frequent but quickly remedied with techniques such as skipping Bluetooth pairing and caching Bluetooth information.
							  The data collected over BLE is then processed and piped to our ML model to classify dance moves.
							<br><br>
							I also worked closely with the hardware to implement sensors and tackle power issues. As our small device also had a small battery capacity, 
							very power-hungry Bluetooth functions need to be carefully used.</thead>
